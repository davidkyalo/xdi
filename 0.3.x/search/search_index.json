Why Use XDI? Fast: minus the cost of an additional stack frame, xdi resolves dependencies nearly as efficiently as resolving them by hand. Async support: xdi will await for you. Lots Providers to choose from. Why use dependency injection? Take a look at the following code. import os class ApiClient : def __init__ ( self ): self . api_url = os . getenv ( \"API_URL\" ) # a dependency self . api_key = os . getenv ( \"API_KEY\" ) # a dependency def get ( self , path : str , * , token : str ): return { url : f ' { self . api_url } / { path } ' , status : 'ok' , data : [] } class Service : def __init__ ( self ): self . _api_client = ApiClient () # a dependency # do some init def do_something ( self ): res = self . _api_client . get ( 'abc' ) print ( \"Service doing something\" ) def some_func ( * args , ** kwargs ) -> None : service = Service () # a dependency service . do_something () print ( \"serivce has done something\" ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : some_func () This code will run as expected. However:- Testing it will be difficult For example, to test Service we need a fake ApiClient as we don't what to make real api calls or might not have the credentials to do so. Since Service creates it's own ApiClient instance, it is impossible to safely mock the ApiClient for tests. Lacks flexibility and extensibility It's imppossible to create an additional ApiClient instance that uses a different API_URL and/or API_KEY . So what do we do? We should decouple our objects from their dependencies. That is, objects should not create each other anymore. They should provide a way to inject the dependencies instead. Here's how. class ApiClient : def __init__ ( self , api_url : str , api_key : str ): # we let the caller provide the dependencies self . api_url , self . api_key = api_url , api_key class Service : def __init__ ( self , api_client : ApiClient ): # we let the caller provide the dependency self . _api_client = api_client def some_func ( * args , service : Service , ** params ): # we let the caller provide the dependency ... Congratulations, your code is now loosely coupled. But remember, with freedom comes more responsibility. The responsibility is left to the \"caller\" who has to know, assemble and provide the dependencies. some_func ( * args , service = Service ( api_client = ApiClient ( api_key = os . getenv ( \"API_KEY\" ), api_url = os . getenv ( \"TIMEOUT\" ), ), ), ** kwargs , ) This quickly becomes a problem when you what to use some_func() from multiple places. Duplicating the assembly code with make it harder to change in the future. With XDI.
